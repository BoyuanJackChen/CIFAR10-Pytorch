# Training CIFAR-10 with ResNet using Pytorch

This is the first group project of ECE7123 Deep Learning I took at NYU Tandon in Spring 2022.

## MiniProject1_G26
Download the CIFAR-10 data from here: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
And put it in the ./data folder. 


## checkpoints
checkpoints folder contains our trained models and their corresponding training loss, testing loss and testing accuracy during training.


## training
```
python training/main.py
```

## loading trained model and testing
```
python training/evaluate_checkpoint.py
```
